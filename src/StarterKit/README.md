# Starter Kit: FrogDataLib Implementation

This directory contains reference implementations for **FrogDataLib**'s two container types `Standard` and `Simple`.

## Directory Information

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`ExampleData.cs`** | The data model definition. Shows how to structure the classes you want to save. |
| **`StarterKitPlugin.cs`** | Demonstrates the **Standard Container** (`FrogDataContainer`). Best for mods that need manual control over save/load timings or custom cleanup. |
| **`StarterKitSimplePlugin.cs`** | Demonstrates the **Simple Container** (`FrogDataContainerSimple`). Best for mods that just need data to "be there" without managing event subscriptions. |
